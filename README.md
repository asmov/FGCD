# FGCD (Fighting Game Community Data)
A universal user input and game mechanics language model for fighting games.

The **FGCD** project:
- Establishes a standard human-readable language for representing user input across multiple products in the fighting game genre.
- Defines a data model that the language can be parsed to and from.
- Maintains an archive of command inputs for as many games within the genre as possible.
- Publishes a freely available multi-platform standalone app that provides move lists for each game archived.
- Offers an optional subscription-based cloud service that allows players to share their own non-official input combinations and strategies with others.

## Proof of Concept
**FGCD** is a proof-of-concept project that acts as testbed for:
- Establishing best practices in cross-platform development using [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri) + [Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew)
- Development of the [sheetflow](https://github.com/asmov/sheetflow) project
- Development of the [traitenum](https://github.com/asmov/traitenum) project
- Establishing best practices in data entry via AI [vision processing](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision)
- Establishing best practices in publishing software using a hybrid business model:
  + Offering free and open-source (FOSS) standalone applications
  + Offering FOSS libraries
  + Extending functionality to an optional online subscription-based cloud web-service (FOSS as well)

The project is maintained by [Asmov Games](https://asmov.games), a division of Asmov LLC.
